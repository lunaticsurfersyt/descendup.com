Hi Guys!! This is me, Sagnik.
I came up with this plan to help fuel the creators' economy
Descendup.com is basically designed to help creators grow their content in an attempt to reach their audience
The problems we are trying to address:
(1)Lack of immediate capital
(2)Monetization of existing content 
(3)Financial unpredictability and instability
(4)Balancing financial management and creativity

How we came up to solve these issues;
How it works?
[1] Proposal and Agreement:
--> Offer 
--> Negotiation
[2] Transfer of Rights:
--> Signing the Agreement 
--> Licensing the back catalogue 
--> Bank automation set-up
[3]Legal and Contractual Purpose
--> Contract drafting 
--> Review 
[4] Revenue Management
--> Descendup.com will monitor the channel's performance to ensure the projected ad revenue is being generated
